## Description
This is a first try to realize an Android project with Android Studio. This is about the gods from greek mythology.

## Motivation
 At the time of greek civilisations, gods were so many that it can be hard to remind of all. Today, there are still people interrested by this subject, so it is still useful.
 
 ## API Reference
 Copied from : https://github.com/kamiranoff/greek-mythology-data/blob/master/data/all.json by kamiranoff              
 The API is not complete but lists already many gods

 ## Build status
