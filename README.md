## Description
This is a first try to realize an Android project with Android Studio. This is about the gods from greek mythology.

## Motivation
 At the time of greek civilisations, gods were so many that it can be hard to remind of all. Today, there are still people interrested by this subject, so it is still useful.
 
 ## API Reference
